-- The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping
-- website which has a desktop and a mobile application.
-- (user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key of this table.
-- The platform column is an ENUM type of ('desktop', 'mobile').
-- Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only and both mobile and desktop together for each date.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Spending table:
-- +---------+------------+----------+--------+
-- | user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
-- +---------+------------+----------+--------+
-- | 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
-- | 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
-- | 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
-- | 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
-- | 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
-- | 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
-- +---------+------------+----------+--------+

-- Result table:
-- +------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
-- | spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
-- +------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
-- | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
-- +------------+----------+--------------+-------------+ 
-- On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2 purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
-- On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.

-- Solution
with abc as (
  select spend_date,user_id,
  platform,amount, count(1) over(partition by user_id, spend_date order by 1) as tot_cnt
  from Spending order by spend_date )
  select spend_date,case when tot_cnt=2 then 'both' else platform end as platform,
  sum(amount) as amount,
  count(distinct user_id) as total_user
  from abc
