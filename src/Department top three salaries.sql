-- | 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
-- | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
-- | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
-- | 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
-- | 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
-- | 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
-- | 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
-- +----+-------+--------+--------------+
-- The Department table holds all departments of the company.

-- | Id | Name     |

-- +----+----------+
-- Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | Department | Employee | Salary |
-- +------------+----------+--------+
-- | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
-- | IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
-- | IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
-- | IT         | Will     | 70000  |
-- | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
-- | Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
-- +------------+----------+--------+

CREATE TABLE Employee (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  salary INT,
  departmentId INT
);

CREATE TABLE Department (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Department (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'IT'),
(2, 'Sales');

INSERT INTO Employee (id, name, salary, departmentId) VALUES
(1, 'Joe', 85000, 1),
(2, 'Henry', 80000, 2),
(3, 'Sam', 60000, 2),
(4, 'Max', 90000, 1),
(5, 'Randy', 85000, 1),
(6, 'Will', 70000, 1);

-- Solution
--department wise salary

select * from  (
select b.name as department
,a.name as employee, a.salary,
dense_rank() over(partition by b.name order by a.salary desc) as rank
from
Employee a inner join Department b
on a.departmentId=b.id) where rank<=3
order by 1,2,3;

select b.name as department
,a.name as employee, a.salary from
Employee a
inner join Department b
on a.departmentId=b.id
where (select count(distinct c.salary) from employee c
where a.departmentId=c.departmentId
and c.salary>a.salary) <=3
order by 1,2,3
